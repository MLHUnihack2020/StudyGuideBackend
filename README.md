# Study Generator Backend

Study Generator Web App @ studygenerator.com

-------------------------------

The backend serves as an API run by Google Cloud Run, so that the frontend can make POST requests to this backend API at any point in time. This way the client is not messed with and all requests are directed through a scalable API run by Google Cloud. We also incorporate Google Cloud Storage to store the PDFs that are generated by the users when they print the questions and answers. The printable PDFs are deleted from the storage bucket after a day to maintain efficient storage.

# Goals

We built StudyGenerator.com in order to help students more efficiently learn information. Instead of having to go through and make their own review, StudyGenerator goes through the text and generates flashcards for you, so you can quiz yourself to make sure you are understanding and comprehending the content.
